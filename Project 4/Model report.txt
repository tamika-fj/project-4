I then trained the model and tested it with a classification report. The model had an accuracy of 0.70 and precision of 0.76 and 0.64 for 0 and 1 (no diabetes and diabetes) respectively. To try and improve the accuracy of the model I then tried random forest, decision tress and k nearest neighbours with the same dataset, this was done in the “Creating a decision tree and random forest model” pandas file . A standard scaler was used to tune the model. Out of the three the random forest model was the most accurate with 0.7, the same accuracy as the logistic regression model and the precision of the 0 value was higher at 0.82, but there was a decrease in the accuracy of the 1 outcome and as this was a health model and we don’t want false negatives further tuning was done. A logistic regression (“creating a model without encoded values”.ipynb), k nearest neighbours, random forest and decision tree model (“creating a decision tree and random forest model without encoded values.ipynb) were then also made with an altered dataset. All the encoded values that had been calculated at data cleaning were dropped. This then lead to an increase in accuracy and precision, with the best model being the logistic regression model. The accuracy increased to 0.77% with an 80% precision score for 0 (no diabetes) and a 0.73 precision score for 1 (diabetes).
